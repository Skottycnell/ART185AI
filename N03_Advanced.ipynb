    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It is not strictly [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) or [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) but combines feature from both [paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). The building-block like structure of neural networks (or rather the useful abstraction of a building-block like structure), however, lends itself to an object-oriented approach. From Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. There is significant diversity of OOP languages, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determine their type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are thus arbitrary structures consisting of methods and attributes. We can regard classes as recipes for building objects, or, conversely, we can regard them as abstraction of (future) objects. Classes define which initial attributes and which methods an object will have at its disposal. Objects are *instantiated* from a class. Classes have several predefines methods starting and ending with double underscores. The most commonly used is `__init__`, which is called once when an object is created. Classes - and thus objects - define their own scope, of course. Hence, all class *methods* must take the `self` argument to pass down a reference to the calling object. An example class `Apple` that makes use of all these techniques could be defined like this:"
